My old code-learning project, completly outdated but still sometimes i like to see what i was doing back in the days :)

*ecourses* - it's a self-learning project to create e-courses platform.
===========================
It's my first portfolio project, i'm trying to get my firs job as webmaster / back-end developer :)
On site i used typical functions like loggin in, registration form, sending form data to back-end, forms validation in PHP and more to come :)
